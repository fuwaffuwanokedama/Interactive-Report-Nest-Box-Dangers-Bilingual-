# Interactive-Report-Nest-Box-Dangers-Bilingual-
This HTML file is a self-contained, interactive web report that scientifically analyzes the thermal risks from in-nestbox cameras to newborn squirrels. Users can visually simulate how internal nest box temperatures can reach dangerous levels by changing conditions like ambient temperature and camera heat output, and learn about concrete solutions.

### **Project Title**
Interactive Report on Nest Box Heat Risks

### **Overview**
This project is a single-page web application designed to raise awareness about the unintended thermal risks caused by cameras installed in wildlife observation nest boxes. Based on scientific data, it visualizes the life-threatening dangers faced by newborn squirrels and presents practical solutions to prioritize animal welfare.

### **Key Features**
* **Interactive Temperature Simulator:** Allows users to manipulate ambient temperature, the presence of solar gain, and camera heat output via sliders and buttons, and see the predicted internal nest box temperature change in real-time.
* **Visual Warning System:** The display color changes and a warning message appears when the predicted temperature reaches Safe, Caution, Danger, or Lethal levels.
* **Click-to-Expand Solutions:** Three main solution categories—Strategic Placement, Design & Modification, and Camera System Improvements—are presented as cards that expand to show detailed explanations upon clicking.
